# README Generator

## Purpose
A command line application created with Node.js and Inquirer.js. The application prompts users for input that is used to generate a README document for the user. Title and description are required, while all other README sections are optional.

Optional sections are: installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions. The questions section includes information about the user's Github name, a link to the user's Github profile, the user's email address, and instructions on how to reach out to the user with questions.

Lastly, an optional table of contents can also be generated. This will be created dynamically based on which sections are included in the README document.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Inquirer.js
